- Manual barcode input fallback [todo]
- Lookup chain: local â†’ OFF importer [in progress] (stub endpoint)

### Dashboards
- Dashboard layout with tabs (Today/History) [done]
- Redirect `/dashboard` to `/dashboard/today` [done]
- Today view: wired to `targets` + aggregated consumed totals [in progress]
- History view: shows recent targets per day [in progress]

### Admin
- Foods list with search and filters [todo]
- Food editor (image upload, nutrients per 100 g, servings) [todo]
- Verify flag and source attribution [todo]
- Analytics: basic metrics dashboard [todo]
- Gate `/admin` by role (profiles.role) [done]

### Privacy & GDPR
- Consent flow (store timestamp/version) [todo]
- Settings: export data (function call) [todo]
- Settings: delete account/data (re-auth + function call) [todo]

### UX/Design
- Implement design system (Appwrite/Health inspired) [todo]
- Mobile-first navigation (tabs) [done]
- Accessibility passes (contrast, keyboard, reduced motion) [todo]

### QA/Perf
- Unit/integration tests for critical flows [todo]
- Performance budgets on search and diary interactions [todo]
- Error monitoring and basic logging [todo]

## Acceptance Criteria (MVP)
- User can sign in, complete onboarding, see targets.
- User can log foods (search/serving/quantity/barcode) and see daily totals vs targets.
- Admin can CRUD foods and view basic analytics.
- Users can export and delete their data.
